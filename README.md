# Hycel-Club

## My first demo project of a SaaS platform, for dogs catchers (and other homeless animals). 

### It's only basic demo project for my CV / portfolio purposes, it's not a real thing ;). 

1. <kbd>Select</kbd> the animal which you are supposed to catch
2. <kbd>Select</kbd> the breed
3. Where it was last seen
4. If it is a priority or not 
5. <kbd>Add</kbd> your task

Now you'll see added animal with appropriate svg 😁.

From here you can decide if task is <kbd>Done</kbd> or you want to cancel it ✅  / ❌ .

✅ When the task is completed, you can see all the catched animals on your lisst of 'catched animals'. 

✅ You will be also rewarded with 1️⃣0️⃣ points, to your 'overal' score as well as 'Top ranking'. 

✅ And finally, with each animal added, you will see progress bar of your daily activity 😄.
